      ****************************************************************
      * This is a sample program which produces a CLASS GRADES
      * REPORT listing student names and averages for four tests.  It
      * also calculates the overall average for the class. (S01)
      * ******
      * INPUT:
      *    The STUDENT GRADE FILE contains the following
      *    data in each record:
      *         1.  STUDENT NAME
      *         2.  THE TEST SCORES FOR EACH OF 4 EXAMS
      *
      * *******
      * OUTPUT:
      *    The GRADE REPORT contains the following information:
      *    ************
      *    DETAIL LINE:
      *         1.  STUDENT NAME
      *         2.  THE AVERAGE OF THE 4 EXAM GRADES FOR EACH STUDENT
      *    *************
      *    FINAL TOTALS:
      *         1.  AVERAGE GRADE OF THE 4 EXAM GRADES FOR ALL STUDENTS
      * *************
      * CALCULATIONS:
      *    TOTAL GRADE FOR EACH STUDENT =
      *        THE SUM OF THE FOUR EXAMS
      *    AVERAGE GRADE FOR EACH STUDENT =
      *        THE TOTAL GRADE FOR EACH STUDENT / 4 (NUMBER OF EXAMS)
      *    TOTAL OF ALL AVERAGES =
      *        THE SUM OF EACH OF THE AVERAGE GRADES
      *    NUMBER OF STUDENTS =
      *        A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE CLASS
      *    AVERAGE GRADE FOR ALL STUDENTS =
      *        THE TOTAL OF ALL AVERAGES / NUMBER OF STUDENTS
